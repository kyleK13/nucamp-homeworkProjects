nucamp online course homework exercises

In this repository I have included a few exercises to display what I have learned so far with my online course for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
Below is a bit of a explanation for each project folder.

CSS Style Practice - In this folder I have both a HTML and a CSS file. For this assignment we learned how to write the styles externally with a seperate CSS file.  
I created a small cafe menu with different boarders for headers, different colors, fonts and a image to occupy the background of the page. I included a review section 
with a ranged input for a rating and a text area for any additional feedback, as well as a submit button and some contact information below that.

DOM Patterns Exercise - In this folder is both a HTML and a JavaScript file. In this exercise we worked with arrays and the DOM attributes to create a colorful circular pattern. 
We did this by writing a function to create new div elements while attaching them to the DOM and moving them to create the pattern.

Dice Game - In this folder is both a HTML and a JavaScript file.  With this project we created a small random number dice game that tallies gold coins depending on the 
roll number.  We wrote a ruleset using titles, headers and an unordered list within our HTML file and called a function script on a button click.  Within the JavaScript funtion
we used for/if loops and continue/break statements to simulate the rolls and we used alerts to return information to the user.

Number Guessing Game - In this folder is both a HTML and a JavaScript file. This exercise is a very simple number guessing game that generates a random number and ask the user to 
guess the correct value while returning alerts if the guess is too large or too small.  We wrote two functions in the JS file to run the game and then check the users guess.  In
this project we make use of do while loops/else if loops to prompt the user then check their guess.

Survey Exercise - In this folder I have both a HTML and a CSS file.  In this exercise we created a basic survey form using what we have learned for input types, placeholders and labels.
We used both radio and checkbox inputs as well as email and text inputs to gather information from the user, and a submit button to send that information.
